# Refactor 1: Flow Executor

[![Level](https://img.shields.io/badge/Level-intermediate-blue.svg)](https://shields.io/)

This is Caravelo's refactoring assignment from intermediate to advanced level.

In this repository you will find low quality code, full of bad smells, with poor packaging, modeling, design &c.

So, we expect from you a refactor of this little fake codebase having the following drivers in mind:
- Readability and conceptual integrity
- Maintainability (i.e. modifying or extending existing functionality and fixing bugs)
- Evolvability (i.e. adding new flows)

You can start with the unit test located in 'src/test' to figure out the expected behaviour. 

Don't pay much attention to semantics of the project since it's a fake use case.
The requirement is clarity and coherence.

## Prerequisites

* Java 8
* [Gradle](https://gradle.org/)

## Instructions

1. Copy this repository.
2. Refactor the code on your own copy.
3. Push the changes to your repository.
3. Notify your repository location to Caravelo's HR contact when done.

### Hints

Clone assignment repo:
```
$ git clone https://git.caravelo.com/recruitment/refactor-1.git
$ cd refactor-1
```
Remove remote origin:
```
$ git remote -v
$ git remote remove origin
```
Point a remote to your own repository:
```
$ git remote add origin <your repository>
```
