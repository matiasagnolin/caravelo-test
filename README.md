# Refactor: Flow Executor

[![Level](https://img.shields.io/badge/Level-intermediate-blue.svg)](https://shields.io/)

This is Caravelo's refactoring assignment from intermediate to advanced level.

In this repository you will find low quality code, full of bad smells, with poor packaging, modeling, design &c.

So, we expect from you a refactor of this little fake codebase having the following drivers in mind:
- Readability and conceptual integrity
- Maintainability (i.e. modifying or extending existing functionality and fixing bugs)
- Evolvability (i.e. adding new flows)

You can start with the unit test located in 'src/test' to figure out the expected behaviour. 

Don't pay much attention to semantics of the project since it's a fake use case.
The requirement is clarity and coherence.
